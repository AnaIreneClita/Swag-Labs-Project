The testing process will be executed based on the application requirements.  


1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad based on the analysis of the specifications. The test cases can be accessed here https://itfclasses.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ANACL/boards/385?issueParent=15057%2C15254%2C15265&issueType=10005


1.5 Test Implementation
The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:


1.6. Test Execution

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: SwagLabs

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: https://itfclasses.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ANACL/boards/385?issueParent=15057%2C15254%2C15265&issueType=10004

The following is a summary of the bugs that have been found 

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.
